## If Interviewr ask about project : 

My current project is called AutoSpare Hub, an online marketplace dedicated to facilitating the buying and selling of auto parts for cars, trucks, and motorcycles. As an Angular developer on this project, my primary responsibilities revolve around the frontend development of the platform.

My role involves working closely with the design and backend teams to translate design mockups and user requirements into responsive and interactive web interfaces. Using Angular, I am responsible for building the frontend components, implementing user interface features, and ensuring seamless navigation and functionality across different devices and browsers.

One of the key aspects of my role is to ensure a smooth user experience by optimizing performance and usability. This involves optimizing page load times, implementing efficient data fetching and caching mechanisms, and conducting thorough testing to identify and fix any bugs or issues that may arise.

Additionally, I collaborate with the backend team to integrate frontend components with the server-side logic, ensuring proper data flow and communication between the frontend and backend systems. This involves consuming RESTful APIs, handling authentication and authorization processes, and implementing data validation and error handling mechanisms.

As part of an agile development team, I actively participate in sprint planning, daily stand-up meetings, and regular code reviews to ensure code quality, maintainability, and adherence to best practices. I also contribute to the continuous improvement of our development processes and tools, sharing knowledge and insights with my colleagues to foster a culture of collaboration and innovation.

Overall, my role in AutoSpare Hub involves leveraging my expertise in Angular development to contribute to the creation of a robust and user-friendly platform that meets the needs of both buyers and sellers in the auto parts industry.
